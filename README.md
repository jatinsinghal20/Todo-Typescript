# Todo-Typescript
In this app you can add new todo by simply entering todo in INPUT field. By default it is added in Active todos.
You can change the  status from active to complete for a todo by checking the CHECKBOX. Unchecking it will again change it to active todos.
You can also update a todo name by clicking on todo. This will show a prompt asking you to give a new name to todo. Enter name and press ok. Todo will be updated.
Also you can delete a todo by clicking on cross button. There is no way to retrieve todo after it is deleted.
